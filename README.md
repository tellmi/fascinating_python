# fascinating_python
collection of code snippets I found useful while programming

For now these code snippets ain't connected, just stored in the same place, some of them ready to execute, some just for copy and paste.
This repository is a copy of my local collection of test- or learning-scripts.
It is set up to learn, how to use GitHub in future for my software project(s).
